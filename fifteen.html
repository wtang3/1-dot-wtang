    <h1 class="fifteen"> Fifteen Puzzle </h1>
    <p class="paragraph">The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares by
    repeatedly making moves that slides the tiles around. Tiles that are moveable are highlighted around its border.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, 
    Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created around 1874
    by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York. </p>
